# Computer Architecture Basics

- **CPU:** Executes instructions, control unit, ALU, registers.
- **Memory (RAM):** Temporary data store for active processes.
- **Bus:** Data paths connecting CPU, RAM, I/O devices.
- **Cache:** Small fast memory between CPU and RAM, reduces latency.
- **Pipelining:** Technique to improve throughput.
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Defines supported instructions.
