- Types:
  - **Supervised Learning:** Labeled data (classification, regression).
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction).
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Agent learns actions by reward feedback.
- Popular algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks.
