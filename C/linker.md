# Linker in C

## Function
Combines object files into executables.

## Types
- Static linking: includes library code → big binary, portable.
- Dynamic linking: uses shared libraries → smaller binary, needs runtime lib.

## Which is better?
Dynamic: saves space, easier updates.
Static: portable, no dependency at runtime.
