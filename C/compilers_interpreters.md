# Compilers and Interpreters in C

## What is a Compiler?
- A compiler translates high-level source code into machine code (object files).
- Checks syntax, optimizes code, generates instructions.
- Example: `gcc main.c -o main`

## What is an Interpreter?
- Directly executes instructions line-by-line.
- C is not typically interpreted, but scripting languages like Python are.
- Example: Pythonâ€™s `python script.py` runs the script without compiling to machine code first.

## Key Differences
- **Compiler:** Entire program is translated before execution.
- **Interpreter:** Code is read and executed line-by-line at runtime.
- **Compiler Output:** Object files, executables.
- **Interpreter Output:** Immediate execution.
